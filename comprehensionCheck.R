# 1.1 Introdcution to machine learning


## Notes on notation
# Outcome Y: that we want to predict
# Features X1, X2..Xp: that we use to predict the outcome (also called predictors, covariates)
# Machine learning approach is to train (tr) an algorithm using a dataset 
# for which we do know the outcome

## Continues vs categorical outcomes
# Y can be any one of K classes, k=1,2,3,4,5,..,K (the list of possible Y's)


# Comprehension Check
# Q1
# True: A key feature of machine learning is that the algorithms are built with data.

#Q2
# True: In supervised machine learning, we build algorithms that 
# take feature values (X) and train a model using known outcomes (Y) 
# that is then used to predict outcomes when presented with features without 
#known outcomes.
